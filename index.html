How to start a game of Age of Empires II

You begin the game with a scout, a town center, and a couple villlagers. Start by selecting your town center using 'left click' and press 'a' to queue a new villager.
If possible, you should always have villagers queued in your town center.
You may also use 'right click' while your town center is selected to set a waypoint for new units to walk to. If the waypoint is set on a resource, the villager will
begin gathering that resource.

Next select a starting villager and press 'b' to open the build menu then press
'q' to select 'house' and place it somewhere near your town center. Houses will
increase your maximum population and allow you to spawn more units. While your house is building you should begin to explore the area around your base with the
scout. Select your scout with 'left click' and move it around using 'right click'.

Now you will need to collect food. Hopefully by now your scout has found some sheep. Select these sheep by double clicking on one of them (this selects all visible sheep)
	, or by dragging a box around them, and move them to your town center. Sometimes the sheep will spawn already converted to your team and you can move them immediately. 
	Once your sheep are near your town center select your idle villagers and right click one of the sheep.

	By now you should have a few more villagers, make sure you build a second house before you reach the population cap. Now send one or two villagers to chop the nearest trees. 
	If you have 100 wood, you should instead build a lumber camp adjacent to a nearby forest. Villagers who gather from nearby trees will deposit the wood in the camp instead
	of walking all the way back to the town center.

	If you haven't found any more sheep with your scout you will soon run out of food. Thankfully there are a few more sources of food. You can build a mill next to a patch of 
	berries, build farms (requires mill and wood), or kill wild animals. Killing wild animals can be difficult for new players so I recommend just building a mill. Make sure you
	put a few more villagers on wood, but keep the majority collecting food.
